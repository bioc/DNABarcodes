Title: A tool for creating and analysing DNA barcodes used in Next
        Generation Sequencing multiplexing experiments

Description: The package offers a function to create DNA barcode sets
        capable of correcting insertion, deletion, and substitution
        errors. Existing barcodes can be analysed regarding their
        minimal, maximal and average distances between barcodes.
        Finally, reads that start with a (possibly mutated) barcode can
        be demultiplexed, i.e., assigned to their original reference
        barcode.
